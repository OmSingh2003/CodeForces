## Usage Tips

1. **Contests**: Name folders with contest number and date (e.g., `div2-847-2023-01-15/`)
2. **Practice**: Organize by problem difficulty or topic
3. **Templates**: Keep reusable code snippets and templates here
4. **Utils**: Store helper scripts for testing, compiling, etc.

## File Naming Convention

- Use descriptive names: `problem-A-watermelon.cpp`
- Include problem letter/number for contests
- Use lowercase with hyphens for readability
